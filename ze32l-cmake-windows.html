                            <p> I usually code on my linux machine but my school doesn't like linux. They have VS2017 installed on WIndows 10 (I think it's on 'creators update'). So my workaround was to make a CMake project and when there's time to work on it on our school PCs, I could just pull my project and generate a native Makefile. Well when I generated 'Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64' everything went smoothly! CMake did its magic and I got a "TestProjectCPP.vcxproj" amp "TestProjectCPP.sln" file along with several. So I've been stewing on this for some of the weekend, and I've tried not to, I know it's not healthy, but still. My company makes cross-platform software. We run primarily Linux and Mac. Unfortunately, as much as I protested, we have one user who refuses to use either and installed Windows 10 (his own license) on his company-issued computer. As we are a small company, and didn't have an IT policy before I joined, management compromised, saying I have no requirement to support him (good Hello all, I am a very non tech-savvy person trying to build vtk on my computer. I've followed multiple tutorials and videos, but I am running into errors. Everytime I try to configure a build I run into this error CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project): Generator Visual Studio 15 2017 could not find any instance of Visual Studio. Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! See also "C:/VTK/bin/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log". amp#x200B; I have visual studio installed. I've a lot of old code that I used to do in my school days. Those code maily used TurboC and DJGPP. For Graphics I mainly rely on Interrrupt 10h and VESA compatibily. I'll just draw everything in an array and then bitblt it to framepointer. Now, I want to port them to modern OS, so that they can run without DOSBOX (Also DOSBOX takes hell a lot of time in compiling). I want to create a cross-platform CMake project. And for display I just need a bitblt support. How to do that or which library. # ATTENTION: THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOW DEPRECATED. PLEASE FOLLOW THE NEW INSTRUCTIONS HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marblemarcher/comments/bamqyh/how_to_configure_and_compile_source_for_windows/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/Marblemarcher/comments/bamqyh/how_to_configure_and_compile_source_for_windows/) Hey there! This is a tutorial to help you configure the Marble Marcher Community Edition source for Windows. So, let's get started. 1. Make sure you have CMake and Visual Studio installed. I'm really. gtgt REALLY ltlt excited to announce version 2.3 (https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/releases/tag/2.3.0) which brings an extensible reporter system (https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/reporters.md) to doctest (https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) - the fastest (https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/benchmarks.md) C++ testing framework! There are 2 reporters which come with the framework by default: - console - normal output. Hi gang, I'm trying to upgrade my klte from los 15 to 16. Since my last major upgrade I've gotten a new computer and have moved from windows to ubuntu. I've just run the following command: sudo apt-get install adb and it was successful. The way I've always done this in the past on my old windows machine was to navigate a cmd window to the platform-tools folder, where I would run all the commands to install my os and packages with sideload. How can I find the platform-tools folder 
Hi Reddit! I am pretty new to the whole programing in C thing but am doing a unit in C at university at the moment. I am currently in the process of completing my first assessment item and am getting rather sick of manually having to switch to cygwin64 to compile and launch the executable. I believe from a little google-fu I can use CMake to compile and run my program with a single click? I have tried to set it up but I can't seem to get the build icon (play button?) to display green Hi everyone, up until now I have been coding C under Ubuntu inside a VM, but it is getting very frustrating to do it this way, because my laptop doesn't handle two machines at the same time very well. I tried to set up a dual boot, but that wasn't too successfull either. My screen flash constantly turning itself off for half a secound and then back on for a couple of secounds and in general did i get more problems with hard drive space (only have a 128gb ssd, it simply got too tight). I'm currently in the process of learning C and I am using Arch Linux to do it. And I am using a minimal setup of just vim and GCC to write my programs. I ran away from C++ at the start of my undergrad but now I want to pick it up again mainly to do some systems or network programming stuff and contribute to some open source projects. My current os is Ubuntu 16.04 Since in the c++ world there are lots of option when it comes to tooling I would like to know the community's recommendation on things like build tools, compilers, linters, package managers, testing frameworks, etc. Also any learning resources recommendations for getting I have a CMake text file but I don't know how to compile it to Windows, or what other files will be depended on to compile. I made this short tutorial do demonstrate how you can we can create a new OpenCV based project on Windows using CMake. Using CMake for this task makes it much easier to target any platform or compiler simply by selecting it from CMake GUI, in addition to requiring no further configuration on other operating systems (Linux, MacOS, etc.). It is especially easy on Linux since CMake's find_package would pick up OpenCV directories automatically without any further configuration Tools Used: CMake. Does anyone have a modern cmake template for qt5? I'm looking for just a basic Window and Button, and a sane cmake configuration. </p>
